plavg.py can be run independently to find the planar 
average of 3D data in a file with cube/xsf format. It
can also be used to plot the .pysave potential files 
generated by the code.

Input file:
&plavg
file_name = ../MoS2.cube # No quotes
file_type = cube         # No quotes. Takes cube/xsf/python
plt_dir = a1 # No quotes. Takes a1/a2/a3. If a1
             # is specified, the data is averaged along a2 
             # and a3 directions and the planar averaged data is plotted 
             # along a1 in a file plavg_a1.plot
factor = 1.0 # factor to be multiplied to the data. If the data is in 
             # rydberg and the plot is needed in eV, specify 
             # factor = 13.60569253. 
cell_dim = 1 # For plotting .pysave files, cell_dim can be 
             # provided. It is the dimension of the cell along 
             # plt_dir.
