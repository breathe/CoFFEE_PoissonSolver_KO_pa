The planar average of the model potential
along a given direction can be plotted using in_V.
Link the V_r.npy file using:
$ln -s ../V_r.npy .

The planar average of the model charge
along a given direction can be plotted using input
in_rho to plavg.py
Link the rho_r.npy file using:
$ln -s ../rho_r.npy .

To run plavg.py:
$your_path_to_CoFFEE/PotentialAlignment/Utilities/plavg.py input

This produces a two column file plavg_(direction).plot which you could
plot using a software of your choice.
