The planar average of the model potential
along a given direction can be plotted using in_V.
Link V_r.npy to this directory: ln -s ../V_r.npy .

The planar average of the model charge
along a given direction can be plotted using input
in_rho to plavg.py
Link V_r.npy to this directory: ln -s ../rho_r.npy .

To run plavg.py:
your_path/CoFFEE/PotentialAlignment/Utilities/plavg.py input

This produces a file plavg_(direction).plot which you could
plot using a software of your choice.
