You can find examples for 1D, 2D and 3D systems here:

1D - BN nanoribbon, B vacancy in charge state -1.

2D - monolayer of MoS2 with S vacancy, in charge state -1

3D - Diamond with a C vacancy in charge state -2.

The complete results for these systems can be found in the 
paper. 

Each directory shows how to perform the corrections on one
super cell of the respective system. 

Fit_gaussian/ directory shows how to fit a Gaussian to
a given cube/xsf file holding the defect wavefunction 
charge density.
