atomic_V.pyx contains the Cython code

Cythonize and generate atomic_V.so using:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

NOTE: the setup.py in this directory is FAKE and exists used just for interactive development purposes -- it does not influence the build performed by the real root setup.py when building the coffee package
