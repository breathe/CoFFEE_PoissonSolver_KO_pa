This folder contains four scripts: classes.py, Solver.py,
PS_main.py and construct_eps.py


classes.py defines the classes: cell, diel_profile and gaussian. 
The parameters in the CELL_PARAMETERS section are attributes of the 
cell class, the parameters in the DIELECTRIC_PARAMETERS section are 
attributes of the diel_profile class and those of the 
GAUSSIAN_PARAMETERS section are attributes of the gaussian class. 
The classes have a number of functions, which read their 
respective sections of the input file, construct the profiles, etc.

Solver.py chooses the solver based on the dielectric profile

PS_main.py contains the Poisson solvers for the 1D, 2D and 3D 
systems. The matvecs are Cythonized. The Cython code for each 
is provided in the directories: MV_1D_cy, MV_2D_cy and MV_3D_cy

construct_eps.py constructs the epsilon profile in real space,
writes to file and Fourier transforms it.
